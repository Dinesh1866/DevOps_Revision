Git is an Distributed open source version control system which allow us to work on different versions of the same file or to work on the histories of a file. allow us to have backup.

different types of version control system,
 1. Local VCS - in local file/server eg:filename_with_time_and_date
 2. centralized VCS - have common server and allow users to have certain code and allow user to lock the code base which they are working, but here everyone don't have whole code eg: CVS, subversion, Preforce
 3. Distributed VCS - everyone has a same updated version of code eg:Git locally and remote- GitHub, GitLab
